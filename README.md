# CreditClustering_KMeans_Python_Project
Using the K-means unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster customers in Python
This was a collabaritive project between myself, Matthew Lanz, and Dingxuan Zhang

The project was to create a blog post to explain the unsupervised learning method K-Means.

We used credit card information as our data set and the cleaned version is the csv file uploaded in this repository.
I wrote the introduction, methods and theory part of the blog post. Matt Lanz wrote the R markdown file. Dingxuan Zhang wrote the python code. I coded up the project in both R and python to help be the middle man and my portion of the python code is uploaded to the repository.
